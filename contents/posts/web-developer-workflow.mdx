# Web Developer Workflow

As someone who does several full stack projects as well as does full stack projects at work, I'd summarize my suggestions as the following:

## Define your general design

You've done this for your frontend already with the UI/UX designs you have for your backend, figure out what the main entities/data you'll be outputting through your first couple of endpoints looks like. You need this so that you can do your frontend layer to consume this data.

## Figure out your infrastructure and architecture

Infrastructure as in what are the pieces you're using in your backend :

(db, api framework, servers, web server - though web server can come when you're actually releasing this project)

UI framework (+ any associated tooling to help compile)

Architecture as in how all your infra components will talk together:

You don't have to do anything formal, just having a mental model of this is good enough but bonus points if u draw a dead simple flowchart.

- Start building your frontend base
- Add models for the data you're going to consume in your frontend if you already know what the data looks like
- Start building out your backend

Even if it's just the simplest endpoint to begin with, as long as you're returning actual data that would be needed by your frontend

- Connect your frontend and backend
- Keep iteratively developing features on both ends or simply flesh out one end first (likely your backend).

As for folder directory, that's up to you but yes the FE and Backends should be in their own self-contained folders. You can go either frontend to backend or back to front but I think what's most important is defining your data models/schemas that you'll be consuming and visualizing on the frontend, even if you're not starting on the actual backend yet. If I already know what kind of data, or initial data, I'm going to get from my eventual API, then I also had models and start building relevant components for them. Having your frontend visualized already is a massive motivating factor as you continue developing and using your backend too (but you can get similar satisfaction backend-first and seeing data actually coming out).
